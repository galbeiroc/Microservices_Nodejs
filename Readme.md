# Introduction to Microservices

Microservices is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, independent services, each running in its own process and communicating through lightweight mechanisms, often HTTP APIs. This approach enables teams to develop, deploy, and scale each service independently, leading to greater flexibility, resilience, and maintainability compared to traditional monolithic architectures.
